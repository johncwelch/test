# test of porting ScutilUtil from ASOC to C#/Xamarin

VSCode's git integration is kind of pants

ASOC version: https://github.com/johncwelch/ScutilUtil
Swift version: https://github.com/johncwelch/scutil

I am amused by Xamarin Mac code showing as "90% ObjC" and only 10# C#

The nice thing about doing the swift version first, the Xamarin version is really similar. Big help.
